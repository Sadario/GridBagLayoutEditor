# Create your working copy

Each group will create one fork of the project.


Make sure to check off the Access level so that this will be "This is a private repository" and "Permissions" to "Inherit repository user/group permissions". This will ensure that no one else gets access to your work put I will still be able to access it to grade it later on.

After the repository is forked the one member on the group that forked the repository should then invite the other members on the group in to the repository. Your are ready to start working on the project.

# Description of the project

[The project description is in the Wiki of the original repository](https://bitbucket.org/okolloen/imt3281-project1-h2017/wiki/Home) (this will not get copied to your fork and you will need to access it trough the original repo.)


# Working on the project

Import the maven project to your favorite IDE, then add the IDE specific files to .gitignore (run "git status" in the project folder to see the files to add to .gitignore. Add the .gitignore file as well, different group members will have different content in this file.)
